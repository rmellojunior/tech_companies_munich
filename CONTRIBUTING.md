# Contributing

If you find something wrong or want to add another company please contribute with a pull request.

Please make sure the following company details are provided:
- Category;
- Company's name;
- Company's link (linked from the company's name);
- Company's careers link, if exists (ðŸš€);
- Company's Github account, or another git-repository manager account, if exists and contains at least one relevant and active repository (:octocat:);
- Company's short description.

How to add a company:
| Company | Description | Locations |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- |
| [Name]() [:rocket:]() [:octocat:]() | ... | `Location` |

Some additional things to keep in mind:
- The company must allow working in/from Portugal;
- Listed offices must have development/tech jobs positions (e.g. a location with only HR functions should not be listed);
- Both links must be valid/working;
- Both links should be HTTPS, if available;
- Mailto links are not allowed;
- Referral links are not allowed;
- The description starts with uppercase, ends with a `.`<!-- and fits in a single line (70 chars max) --> ;
- Locations must be written in english;
- Locations must be enclosed in an inline code block (using with backtick quotes `) and separated by spaces;
- Both companies and locations are ordered alphabetically;
- Feel free to suggest a new category and explain it in the commit message;
- If a company would fit in multiple categories, only the one category that fits best must be selected.

Thanks for contributing!
